This is text.
New line in source.  
Double Space Character is Newline in Markdown.

Italic works with *asterisks*.  
Bold works with **double asterisks**.  
Italic bold works with **_underscore and asterisks_**  
Strikethrough works with ~~two tildes~~.

This is a simple list.
* First point.
* Second point.

This is an ordered list:
1. First
2. Second

`Highlight` some words with accent grave.

This is a simple table:
| Col1 | Col2 |
|-----|------|
| Line1Col1 | Line1Col2 |
| Line2Col1 | Line2Col2 |

This is code in triple accent grave with language code in first line:
```js 
if (this === that):
    try doSomething()

    except boom as e:
        return
```
